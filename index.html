    <p>
      cEDH is a format of Magic the Gathering.
      It is viewed as "competitive" in that
      players are playing to win and deploying
      a uniquely large amount of differing
      strategies and cards to bring about that
      result. This website utilizes a sort of
      "ELO" algorithm, meant to better
      quantify cEDH players based on factors
      outside of wins such as turn order and
      the general skill level of their
      opponents.

*Tracking Skill in cEDH*

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

cEDH is a way to enjoy a popular card game known as Magic the Gathering (MTG). This style of play involves four people engaging in a complex free-for-all format. This uncommon play dynamic means that performance isn't always accurately measured as "winning and losing". Here at Prowess, we have devised a series of algorithms that accurately track, rank, and quantify skill in this complicated game of strategy and social decite. All you have to do is keep playing as normal, but let us know who won!
